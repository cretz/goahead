Following along with inheritance, since Go provides multiple inheritance and Java 8 allows static and default interface
methods, we are just going to do it like inheritance and make the "dispatcher" still an interface. However, we might
also make an init-less static object for static methods. And basically static methods for the default methods...we'll see.

TODO: please add "discriminator"/"marker" functions on all interfaces (and impl where necessary) to
  prevent structural-typing ambiguity
